# Gazebo ros_control Interfaces

This is a ROS package for integrating the `ros_control` controller architecture
with the [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) simulator.

This package provides a Gazebo plugin which instantiates a ros_control
controller manager and connects it to a Gazebo model.

For documentation, please read [the tutorial on the Gazebo website](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_control).

## Future Direction
